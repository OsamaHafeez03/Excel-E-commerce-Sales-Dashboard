# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Dashboard
## 🎞 Project Overview
This dashboard provides a strong, high-level overview of a $649k e-commerce business operating within California. The company is experiencing healthy week-over-week sales growth, driven primarily by its mobile App. Operational efficiency is a key strength, with an average delivery time of just 2.3 days and a solid 4.0-star customer rating.

Key opportunities lie in leveraging the dominant 'App' channel for further growth, refining marketing to align with the primarily female customer base, and developing a strategy to mitigate the risk of 100% market concentration in California.
## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Interpretation 🎯
Based on the aggregated data (Pivot.csv and the dashboard), the core business metrics are:

✔️ Total Revenue: $649k

✔️ Total Orders: 2,400

✔️ Total Quantity Sold: ~12,000

✔️ Average Order Value (AOV): $270.42 ($649k / 2,400)

✔️ Insight: A $270 AOV is substantial and indicates customers are either buying high-value items or multiple items per order.

✔️ Average Units Per Order (UPO): ~5.0 (12k / 2,400)

✔️ Insight: This confirms customers are purchasing multiple items (bundles), which is a positive sign. This UPO should be protected and grown through bundling or "you might also like" recommendations.

✔️ Avg. Customer Rating: 4.0 stars

✔️ Insight: This is a solid score, suggesting general customer satisfaction.

✔️ Avg. Days to Deliver: 2.3 days

✔️ Insight: This is an excellent, highly competitive shipping speed.

## 2. Detailed Analysis & Actionable Insights 💡
### Sales & Revenue 📈
✔️ Sales Trend (13-Week): The dashboard and Pivot.csv data show a clear upward trend in both sales revenue and quantity sold over the 13-week period. There appears to be some volatility with significant peaks (e.g., around Week 6 and Week 8/9).

✔️ Insight: The business is in a growth phase.

✔️ Recommendation: Investigate what drove the sales peaks. Were these specific marketing campaigns, promotions, or product launches? Replicating these successful events is key to accelerating growth.

## Channel Performance (Order Mode) 📱
✔️ Dominant Channel: The 'App' is a clear winner, driving the vast majority of sales. The 'Website' is a strong secondary channel, with 'Instagram' showing potential as a tertiary social commerce channel (Pivot 2.csv).

✔️ Insight: This is a mobile-first business. The customer base is highly comfortable purchasing through the native app.

### Recommendation:

✔️ Double-Down on the App: Prioritize investment in the app's user experience (UX/UI), feature set (e.g., personalized recommendations, push notifications), and in-app marketing.

✔️ Optimize Website: Ensure the website experience is seamless, especially for new customer acquisition, as it's the second-most-popular channel.

✔️ Explore Instagram: The 'Instagram' channel, while smaller, is a direct line to a visual, mobile-first audience. Test targeted ad campaigns and "Shop" features to grow this channel.

## Customer & Market Analysis 👥
✔️ Customer Demographics: The 'Gender Split' chart and Pivot 2.csv data show that the customer base skews significantly female.

✔️ Geographic Market: All sales data (Data.csv, Pivot 2.csv) is from California. The dashboard map visualizes sales hotspots by county.

✔️ Insight: The business has a well-defined, but highly concentrated, customer profile.

### Recommendation:

✔️ Targeted Marketing: All marketing imagery, ad copy, and product selection should be tailored to the core female demographic.

✔️ Market Risk Mitigation: Relying 100% on a single state is a significant risk (e.g., economic downturn, new regulations).

✔️ Expansion Strategy: Use the insights from California's top-performing counties (e.g., Los Angeles, Sacramento from Data.csv) to build "lookalike" customer profiles and target similar metropolitan areas in neighboring states (e.g., Arizona, Nevada) as a first step toward geographic expansion.

### Product & Operational Performance 📦
✔️ Product Popularity: The "Top Products" chart identifies the key revenue drivers.

✔️ Operational Efficiency: As noted, the 2.3-day average delivery is exceptional and is likely a key driver of the 4.0-star rating.

✔️ Insight: The logistics-to-satisfaction pipeline is working very well.

###  Recommendation:

✔️ Inventory Management: Ensure the "Top Products" are never out of stock. Consider these "hero" items for marketing.

✔️ Market Your Strength: The 2.3-day delivery time is a powerful competitive advantage. This should be explicitly stated on the website, in ads, and in the app checkout process ("Get it in 2-3 days!").

✔️ Improve Rating to 4.5+: To push the 4.0-star rating higher, analyze the raw Data.csv for any orders with 1 or 2-star ratings. Look for patterns: was it a specific product? A specific county? A longer-than-average delivery? Addressing these specific pain points can lift the average.
